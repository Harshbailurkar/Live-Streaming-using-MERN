In Frontend I just use simple react components, to generate these stream keys and URL , view  all live streams , watch stream etc.

note: first go to /login to login then you will able to watch live streams.

Note:
you need to replay your LiveKit URL,API,and Token.
also you need to configure livekit WebHook, for that you need your application endpoint.

happy coading
